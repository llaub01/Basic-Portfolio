		<p>Hi!.. I’m Lonnie Laub. I’m passionate about tech, I love learning and love helping people. I take immense amounts of pride in what I do, day to day. I am also a huge fan of the incredible tech/start-up scene explosion happening in Kansas City and try to do everything I can to assist and nurture start-ups and entrepreneurs in the area. I've been told I'm a jack-of-all trades, a great flex-man, great at explaining something incredibly technical into laymen terms, as well as "you should be a life coach." Somewhat of a broad spectrum but honestly I really enjoy wearing multiple hats throughout the day to help scrum towards some greater company goal. I love working hard at a place where voices are easily heard and I can use my leadership skills, tech skills and creativity to solve problems... then create policies and procedures around these solutions, look for ways to improve on any inefficiencies and inspire others to follow. Team collaboration is incredibly important to me as well so I do everything I can to strive for this, daily. I also love a strong company vision and do what I can to embrace unified employee buy in into said vision.</p>
